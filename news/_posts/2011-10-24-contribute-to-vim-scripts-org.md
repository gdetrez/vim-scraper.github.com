Hello Vimmers!

All of you probably know that [vim-scripts.org] mirrors [all vim.org scripts on Github](http://vim-scripts.org/vim/scripts.html) making them [available as git repos](https://github.com/vim-scripts).

[Scott](https://github.com/bronson), the author of [vim-scripts.org](http://vim-scripts.org) did a great job with implementing and running it (at his own expense btw).  Still it can be even better!

For obvious reasons Scott's open-source-hours are limited as well as [mine](http://github.com/gmarik).
Therefore in order to improve [vim-scripts.org] we're looking for those of you interested in contributing your expertise.

Here's general outline on what needs to be done:

1. new website [theme](https://github.com/vim-scraper/vim-scraper.github.com/issues/9), logo, [favicon](https://github.com/vim-scraper/vim-scraper.github.com/issues/10)
2. Jekyll fixes: [pagination](https://github.com/vim-scraper/vim-scraper.github.com/issues/6), [news dupes](https://github.com/vim-scraper/vim-scraper.github.com/issues/7)
3. Language improvements all over the site: [edit down](https://github.com/vim-scraper/vim-scraper.github.com/issues/2)
4. List of all [web-site UX/UI improvements](https://github.com/vim-scraper/vim-scraper.github.com/issues)
5. [scraper bugfixes](https://github.com/vim-scraper/vim-scraper/issues), lots of them

Yeah, lots to be done!

In case you cannot contribute with your skills you can always [ donate ](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=TPRYUWB49GUAU) to support the project.

Discussion is welcomed so make sure to leave your [comment](#comments).

Thanks all, let's make Vim ecosystem better!
